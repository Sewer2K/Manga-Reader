## Changing the Manga

### Steps to Change the Manga

1. **Find the Manga ID**:
   - Go to [MangaDex](https://mangadex.org/) and search for the manga you want to display.
   - Copy the manga ID from the URL. For example, the ID for *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* is `b0b721ff-c388-4486-aa0f-c2b0bb321512`.

2. **Update the Code**:
   - Open `script.js` and `chapter-script.js` in your code editor.
   - Locate the `mangaId` variable:
     ```javascript
     const mangaId = 'b0b721ff-c388-4486-aa0f-c2b0bb321512'; // Replace with your manga ID
     ```
   - Replace the default ID with the new manga ID.

3. **Save and Deploy**:
   - Save the changes and redeploy the site (if hosted on Netlify or another platform).
